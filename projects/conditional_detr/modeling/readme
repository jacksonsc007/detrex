1. Symetrical disign. Same number of dec and enc layers. 
2. The first encoder layer don't use mask from decoder output.
3. skip encoder directly if mask from decoder specifies that all locs are invalid.
4. predictor for box and class are shared among all decoder layers.
5. fixed threshold for selectio is adopted. Further consider coarse-to-fine design, topk, etc.
